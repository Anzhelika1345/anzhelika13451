<h1>Propaganda Tactics In North Korea</h1>
<br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>North Korea is one of the closed countries from the outside world and there are a lot of myths about it. There are claims about North Korea that are made in western media, however it is important to see the true background and the propaganda tactics that build a current “empire”. One of the types of propaganda that are being used is political followed with psychological effects on individual. Most influential propaganda tactics that are being used is authority, as well as social proof and scarcity. Authority is most influential of them all. The leaders of the country were drawn to themselves a mother-like and almost a God’s image. Making people scared of the consequences for their actions and the actual ruler of the country is a tactic that is used in order to gain control and influence using status. Another tactic is social proof, people are used to a certain lifestyle, because everyone is living it. People are scared of changing their way of living, because of the punishment that will come from the authority or scarcity of losing it all. It is important to understand what are ideologies that North Koreans have and why do they have them. How public opinions are influencing an individual mind and how authority is able to control the way people think. It is important to understand the background of the propaganda and the consequences of it. What are the ways people are persuaded, for example posters, paintings, short stories, movies. It is valid to know how North Koreans view the “outside world” to understand the ideology and their values. </p>

<h2 id="background">Background of the propaganda</h2>

<p>
Japanese campaign "Japan and Korea as one body" (1930) proclaiming the message of being "one people" and having pure same racial bloodline. The idea was that both Japanese and Koreans had unique race that is superior than other. The postcard from that campaign shows the message it has an image of two boys one of who is Korean and other Japanese running around the world together. Japanese wanted for Koreans to have pride in their culture and being cooperating with Japan. This tactics of propaganda was extremely influential that upper class people in Korea started talking in Japanese, they were accepting that culture as the part of their own. The ideology and propaganda was spread throughout Korea without force. Society was shifted in an ideology of a “pure race” and in 1945 Koreans got rid of Japanese while sticking to the developed values. Koreans believe that because of them being morally superior they been invaded so often. “Our virtue makes us an easy prey”. The events that was happening made people indeed for a leader that can protect them without them having a fear of being invaded.  The ideal is for people remaining naive in North Korea, Kim/Party is equal to a mother/protector. Kim Cult worldview, racial purity the North Korean leader were pictured riding a white horse which represents racial purity. </p>

<h2 id="authority">Authority</h2>
<p>In North Korea authority holds extreme value for citizens. Kim Jong Il was referred to a parent “We who are a mother and her children, one blood… Our Great Mother, General Kim Jong Il! KCN (10.10.2003). When referring to a leader as a parent people hold a different value to his “commands”. Kim Jong Il has a likability from people, because for them he was like a “mother” which brings emotional closeness and feelings towards a leader. Early on, children are taught that they need to listen to their parents. In this case authority uses it against people, to “brainwash” them. There is a lot of parent symbolism: Motherland, Mother General, Mother Party and Child Race. One of the painting in B.R. Mayer’s book shows and image of Kim Il Sung visiting kinder garden, the snow is white and white is usually associated with purity and innocence. Children have a cheerful smile and the leader looks as father figure and a hero. Young girls in North Korea are expected to stay child-like or girlish even when they grow up. Since the leader is seen as a “mother figure” it is another way for authority to persuade the masses by making them child-like and naive. The media portraits images that the authority has total control of, psychologically whatever they see on television or hear on the radio it triggers them to follow it. There is an extreme glorification of the military. People The television news reporters quote Kim Jong Il said about the military “the university of revolution” “magnificent school of ideological, intellectual and psychological training”. Kim Jong Il also said that he loves warriors most of them all, which makes people believe that military holds extreme importance and someone who is a part of it is seen as brave and a hero. People always want to be accepted by a society and feel like they are “somebody”. For an individual this would gave a satisfactory feeling of validation. Furthermore, civilians would not want to disappoint the “mother figure”. People are triggered in this case to be adored and liked by the leader, same as they would want to make their mother or father proud. Authority made people believe that North Koreans have the “better race”, “outstanding race” and “pure”. Authority manipulates people into believing that they are a superior race, in order to gain control.
<br />
There is a lot of monuments of the leaders in North Korea, which gives extreme value to a leader. To my mind, one of most important monuments in North Korea that is clear example of how much pride North Koreans have in their authority is Mansudae Grand Monument. First of all, these monuments draw the idea that the leaders are superior than the civilians. It is bronze 22 meters’ statue which shows the idea of extreme importance and value of a party and shows to what extremes propaganda can get. From the young age, North Koreans are made to believe that they are not missing anything in their life. For a long time, North Koreans believed that they have a better life, than South Koreans. However, information was leaked that people are economically having a better life in South Korea. After this incident, the authority came up with a different way of controlling people. There was a poster where South Koreans are praising Kim Jong-un which sends a clear message, that it does not matter that people in South have all those riches they are ashamed of their “Yankee lifestyle”.</p>

<h2 id="psycho">Psychological effects of propaganda</h2>

<p>Propaganda can have a long term psychological consequences of one’s mind. It can shift stereotypes and certain ideas that are beneficial to the one who is proclaiming the propaganda. Psychological effects could be fatal, individuals will be exposed to it to a point where they accept those beliefs that are proclaimed and no longer have control over their own mind. Hyeonseo Lee who escaped from North Korea and now is an activist who lives in the South Korea, have said that growing up she was made to believe that her country is the best in the world. “When I was young, I thought my country was the best on the planet,” “I grew up singing a song called ‘Nothing to Envy’. I felt very proud. I thought my life in North Korea was normal, even though when I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.” TED Talk 2013. This is a clear example to how propaganda can effect one’s way of critical thinking. Kim Jong-un uses his title and the mother image to his advantage. Psychologically people are triggered into a blind obedience. If people are told from childhood that authority is trustworthy and should not be questioned, then the circle of propaganda continues for generations and a ruler could establish a beneficial empire for himself.
<br />
<h2 id="social proof">Social proof</h2>
<p>Social proof is one of the propaganda weapon that are used in North Korea to manipulate the audience, target. One of the social proofs that authority used are paintings, television, radio. People tend follow what they see on media. For example, in the paintings people appear similar-looking. Men have similar haircuts and women have similar clothes. Being as everyone else is presented as ideal. As well as, Airing mass games where people appear to look-alike and it is shown as a celebration of being superior race than everyone else, however the claim is being superior morally rather than physically or intellectually. This type of propaganda makes people unconscious of the manipulation, since everyone acts the same. They feel a certain pride in being the “clean race”. “No masses are purer than our masses” Cheollima (2005). People believe that because they race have been “pure blooded” for a long time they are homogenous and that makes them love each other more than other nations. This type of propaganda is also irrational because it is based on feelings – passion for one’s country. It turns people almost into “slave-like” mentality. The point is to blend an individual into the mass. It is traumatizing experience for a person psychologically, because when one is being exposed to propaganda to the point where he no longer can suppress it he accepts the beliefs and the ideas not of his own but the ones that are presented. He becomes dependent on the opinions and beliefs that propaganda shaped him to believe. “Brainwashed” individual loses judgmental and critical thinking. Moreover, person no longer want to be seen as the a true individual he wants to be as everyone else – a part of the mass, accepting public opinion as his own. “Propaganda furnishes objectives, organizes the traits of an individual into a system, and freezes them into a mold by standardizing current ideas, hardening the prevailing stereotypes, and furnishing thought patterns in all areas.” Ellul, Jacques (1973). Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, p. 162-163. When one sees himself no longer as individual but a part of the group that has been “brainwashed by propaganda that’s when he becomes psychologically degraded as a person he loses control and relies on impulses. After psychologically being suppressed individual continues on living a life where he relies on social standards and opinions in the “reality” that was brought by a powerful propaganda. To my mind by making people believe that they are morally better or “outstanding” than other nationalities, makes people separate themselves away from the outside world. In Ellul’s book Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes is stated that in propaganda there are 2 groups "double foray on the part of propaganda that proves the excellence of one group and the evilness of another at the same time to create partitioning" Ellul, Jacques (1973). Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes. This authority can influence people making them believe in their superiority and morality by doing that separating them from the outside. For a long time, authority was being successful at it, North Koreans did not know what was going on in the South. After the true reality was known to the masses, the leader made people believe that even though the life is better in the “outside world”, they respect North Koreans because of their morality and they will never be as “clean” as them. By separating the mass away from the outside world makes it easier for the persuader to manipulate the audience.<p/>
<br />
<h2 id="scarcity">Scarcity</h2>
<p>Authority in North Korea uses scarcity in order to control people’s actions. Those North Koreans who are trying to get out of the country, if they are caught there is going to be consequences. For example, North Koreans who are illegal immigrants caught by a Chinese police are send back to the North Korea. The fait that they usually have to face is not as pleasant – tortured, publicly executed or imprisoned. I believe those tactics are used in order to scare the mass. Civilians who are hoping for a better life in another country, would have to think twice before trying to escape. The scarcity of losing everything that they have now, for a better lifestyle affects their actions and decisions. Moreover, the consequences that comes with trying to escape from the propaganda and the current situation makes those people look as if they were criminals. This draws a certain image to the majority. “People have to hide their identities just to survive, even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world could be turned upside down in an instant. That’s why after 10 years of hiding my identity I decided to risk going back to South Korea” Hyeonseo Lee (TED Talk 2013). People are influenced by one of influential propaganda weapon which scarcity and scarcity is based on less is more. Civilians will accept whatever lifestyle they have at the moment, because they are scared of authority punishing them. Public execution is one of the scarcity weapons that authority uses. It is used in order to show what consequences can lead to someone trying to escape the “propaganda bubble” and this way they can control actions of the majority. The government is trying to lead people on by portraying South as a “dangerous place” to live in. “Do you know how many cars are stolen every year? The place is full of thieves. 120 people disappear every day, everywhere there are assault, violent gangs, the subway is a hell-way…”. This representation of the South is a way to effect the target by using scarcity. In this situation most of people are triggered and their mind will lose stability, because of their body entering the “survival mode”.<p/>

<h2 id="north Korea">How North Koreans view foreigners</h2>
<p>There is a lot of propaganda in paintings, for example foreigners always look unpresentable, while Koreans look attractive. American hatred is a part of North Korean ideology. Americans in paintings made look as “bad guys”, for example in one of the painting there was completely fictional murder of Korean child by American missionaries. Anti-American propaganda is extremely huge in North Korea; they have posters where Washington DC is being destroyed.  There is a lot of myths about Americans that are proclaimed. There has been talked about how Americans enslaved millions of Africans, calling them Yankees and the idea of them never being a “clean race”. “Just as a jackal cannot become a lamb, the Yankees cannot change their savage nature” Kim Jong Il. Moreover, the propaganda is stating that Koreans should never be on good terms with them and “Americans are referred to bastards”. “School books encourages citizens to speak of Yankees having muzzles, snouts and paws; as croaking instead of dying, and so on.” This draws a certain picture of how Korean people see Americans. It seems like North Koreans have tendency being racist, they allow themselves talk negatively towards another races or nationalities. In their art, posters or magazines they like to show Americans having a big nose, sunken eyes and dark skin even though them having Caucasian features. “The old jackal’s shade-shaped eagle’s nose hung villainously over his upper lip, while the vixen’s teats jutted out like the stomach of a snake that has just swallowed a demon, and the slippery wolf-cub gleamed with poison like the head of venomous snake that has just swallowed its skin. Their six sunken eyes seemed… like open graves constantly waiting for corpses.” The Cleanest Race B.R. Mayers. They consider that Americans being a contaminated race. The goal of authority is to get rid of “Yankees” in the peninsula and come together with the mother land, but certain sacrifices has to be made – sacrificing material comfort of the civilians. The political propaganda is influencing people, by making them believe that American are the enemies, Kim Jong un spends a lot of resources on the military while country is economically troubled. I believe that in this case the idea is to show that North Korea is protecting their purity of the race and Americans are viewed as a race enemy. North Koreans believe that compared to South Korea which is striving economically, North is driven by protecting their values and importance of their culture and race, while trying to take down the ultimate enemy.


The propaganda tactics and the history background of North Korea shifted civilians and the ideologies that they have to this day. One of the strongest aspects of the country is their military, since most of the countries resources are going there. From the history background it is clear that people were exposed to propaganda by Japanese and were indeed of ruler who would protect them and be a “shoulder to rely on”. By focusing on the interests of the mass, the leaders gained control over the mind of the nation and the “green light” to spreading the propaganda. Persuading people having to rely fully on the leader, having “child-like purity” in order to use it to the advantage of the authority. Using scarcity as a tactic to make people scared of the leader is one of the most powerful ways to gain control over nation. The scarcity of having to deal with consequences of one’s actions, for example public execution is a way to trigger people’s mind into “surviving mode”. The statement of “clean race” is used against people. In order to separate North Koreans from the outside world and using it to their advantage. As an example is using sources for a military, while civilians struggle economically to survive. The monuments give the party importance and pride for people. Majority lost their ability of defense against the propaganda, since it is everywhere surrounding them. It is a circle of generations and it is extremely hard to suppress it, once it was so heavily nested in a society.<p/>
